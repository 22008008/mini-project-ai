# RESULTS AND IMPACT
The heart disease prediction project utilizes diverse algorithms to deliver accurate risk assessments, enabling healthcare professionals to make informed decisions and enhance early detection strategies. By integrating clinical and demographic data, it facilitates personalized patient care and improves health outcomes. Its scalable approach allows adaptation to other health conditions, promoting a proactive stance in preventive healthcare and benefiting public health.We have got two types of output in which output-1 is executed with predefined dataset and all ml algorithms provide average accuracy of 0.84% .In ouput-2 in which we get instant data provide diffrent accuracy for different algorithms in which, Naive Bayes Accuracy and Logistic Regression Accuracy has the highest accuracy of 0.91%. Therefore, we conclude that Naive Bayes,Logistic Regression,SVM,AdaBoost,MLP Neural Network produce more accurate prdictions.
